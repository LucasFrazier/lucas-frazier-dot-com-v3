# lucasfrazier.com (v3)

## About the Project

This is my personal website.

Currently, v3 serves as my portfolio with simple "About" and "Contact" pages.

I'm currently focusing on fleshing out my project content for my portfolio, but I do plan to add additional features in the future. For example, I'd like to add a blog and feature music I've made as well.

All in good time. Thanks for checking out the code.
